## Features

- **Textbook Ingestion:** Upload a PDF of the textbook you want to analyze and gain insights from.

- **Expert Query System:** The app processes the textbook's content to create an expert query system but requires some manual insertion of regex patterns to find chapter starts and endings depending on the format of your textbook. You can ask questions related to the textbook, and the app will provide accurate and relevant answers.

        "explanation": "A MAN is confined to a certain geographic area, such as a university campus or city. No formal guidelines dictate the differences between a MAN and a WAN; technically, a MAN is a WAN. Perhaps for this reason, the term MAN is used less frequently than WAN. If any distinction exists, it\u2019s that a MAN is smaller than a WAN. A MAN is almost always bigger than a LAN and usually is smaller than or equal to a WAN. MANs utilize an Internet service provider (ISP) or telecommunications (telco) provider."

With such a configuration, a new device can be added to the network by attaching the new device to the hub with its own cable. This process does not disrupt the users who are currently on the network. Answers A and B are incorrect because the addition of new network devices on a ring or bus network can cause a disruption in the network and cause network services to be unavailable during the installation of a new device."

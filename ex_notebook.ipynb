VLANs allow for the creation of multiple broadcast domains on a single switch, which is the same as creating separate networks for each VLAN. VLANs offer increased security, performance, and simplified administration. VLAN membership can be determined by protocol, port, or MAC address. With protocol-based VLANs, computers are assigned to VLANs using the protocol that is in use and the Layer 3 address. With port-based VLANs, specific ports on a network switch are assigned to a VLAN. With MAC address-based VLANs, the Media Access Control (MAC) address is used to assign membership to a VLAN. VLAN segmentation provides a new level of administrative flexibility, organization, and security.\n"
